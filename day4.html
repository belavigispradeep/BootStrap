   <h1>Ozymandias</h1>
   <h3>by Percy Bysshe Shelley</h3>
   <p>I met a traveller from an antique landb <br>
    Who said: Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br>
    Stand in the desart.[d] Near them, on the sand,<br>
    Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown,<br>
    And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command,<br>
    Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br>
    Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br>
    The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed: <br>
    And on the pedestal these words appear: <br>
    "My name is <span>Ozymandias</span>, King of Kings: <br>
    Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" <br>
    No thing beside remains. Round the decay <br>
    Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br>
    The lone and level sands stretch far away.</p>
